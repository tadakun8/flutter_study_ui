# api_with_http_package

This project is to learn how to use the http package to get data from API and how to display that data on the screen.

In this project, I used FutureBuilder Widget to display the data retrieved from the API on the screen.

I used `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums` for the API.
