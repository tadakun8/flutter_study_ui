# future_provider

This project is to learn how to use the http package to get data from API and how to display that data on the screen.

The difference between [api_with_http_package](https://github.com/tadakun8/flutter_study/tree/main/networking/api_with_http_package) and this one is that I used FutureBilder to display the data.
