# store_data_locally

This is a sample project to help me understand how to implement storing information in a device (ios or Android).

## memo

It looks like there are four ways to do this.

1. Use SQLite
1. Use SharedPreferences package
1. Use flutter_secure_storage package
1. Use local file storage
