# scroll_controller

This project is a sample project to help me understand how to use ScrollController.

## App Feature

- Display a scrollable list.
- Scrolling is possible with the bottom button.
- Notify when scrolling is about to end.

## Demo

## Memo

`HookConsumerWidget` is not working on web.

To be more precise, chrome would start up, but the loading screen would take a very long time and the intended screen would not appear.
